# Drug Molecule Property Prediction and Generation

This project uses deep learning techniques to predict properties of drug molecules and generate new molecular structures using SMILES representations.

## Features
- Predict molecular properties such as solubility, toxicity, and drug-likeness.
- Generate novel drug-like molecules based on training data.
- Visualize molecular structures and properties.

## Background
This project leverages:
- **SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System):** A textual representation of chemical structures.
- **Deep learning models:** Such as RNNs, GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks), and Transformers for molecule prediction and generation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alice-LeileiSun/drug-molecule-prediction.git
